# Example of creating layers and sublayers in the Syncfusion Blazor Maps component

In this Blazor project, we created a sample to show users how to create layers and sublayers in the Syncfusion Blazor Maps component. Specifically on the following conditions:

1. Geometry shape as a sublayer over GeoJSON map layer
2. Geometry shape as a sublayer over any online map layer
3. Polygon shape as a sublayer over GeoJSON map layer
4. Polygon shape as a sublayer over any online map layer
